# Fisheries biologist

## Who am I?

I graduated in Environmental Biology with a specialization in Marine Biology from the Faculty of Science at the University of Lisbon (FCUL), and I have recently obtained my master's degree in Marine Ecology at the same university. I am fascinated by Fisheries Biology and believe it's crucial to connect scientific findings with our everyday world in an accessible and straightforward manner for everyone. I am very enthusiastic, positive and always eager to learn more, detail-oriented, motivated, and creative in any task assigned. I am capable of conducting both laboratory and fieldwork and work well in a team as well as under pressure. I also have training as Environmental Educator.
