# Fisheries biologist

## About me

I am an Environmental Biologist with a deep-rooted passion for Marine Biology and a specialization in Fisheries Biology and Marine Ecology. I hold both a bachelor's degree in Environmental Biology and a master's in Marine Ecology from the University of Lisbon's Faculty of Sciences (FCUL). 

My passion lies in understanding fish life-history strategies, population dynamics, and the application of statistical modeling to address pressing challenges in fisheries science. I am particularly driven by the need to bridge scientific findings with real-world applications, ensuring that research informs sustainable fisheries management and conservation efforts in accessible and impactful ways. Currently, I am a Research Collaborator at MARE-ULisboa (Marine and Environmental Sciences Centre), where I work with the Fisheries Biology Lab on fish life-history and genetics projects. Beyond the aquatic world, I venture into terrestrial systems, collaborating with the SRIT and BLIZ teams at the Stockholm Resilience Centre on population dynamics models for mammals and plants. 

As a field and laboratory researcher, I thrive in team settings, bringing motivation, creativity, and a meticulous eye for detail to every project. I also have a background in Environmental Education, which has reinforced my commitment to making science accessible and impactful for diverse audiences. My ultimate goal is to contribute to fisheries research that not only advances our understanding of aquatic ecosystems but also drives solutions for their sustainable management.

## What have I been up to?

### Projects

**SRIT - Development of a Species Resilence Impact Tool | 2024-Present**
- Focus Area: Terrestrial Ecology & Data Management
- Part of the FinBio Project, financed by MISTRA and hosted at the Stockholm Resilience Centre.
- Led data collection, extraction, and compilation tasks for terrestrial mammals’ life-history traits from multiple databases, to serve as input for the RangeShifter model.
- Created species suitability landscapes and mine impact landscapes to assess resilience under disturbance scenarios.
- Calculated species resilience and community metrics, integrating these into actionable conservation models.
- Processed and analyzed spatial data to support model development and improve predictive accuracy.

Athough we did not make it in the final round this project has been the Country Winner for Sweden in the global “T4PF - Capgemini”.

**BLIZ - Interactions between society, land use, ecosystem services and biodiversity in Bavaria until 2100 | 2024-Present** 
- Focus Area: Data Visualization, Biodiversity Modeling & Sensitivity Analysis
- Subproject 2: Biodiversity Tipping Points in Climate and Land Use Change, funded by the climate research network Bayklif, an initiative of the Bavarian State Ministry of Science and the Arts.
- Data visualization for species distribution model outputs (MetaRange) using R
- Conducted spatial data manipulation, created population- and individual-level plots, and performed sensitivity analyses.
Proficient in the ggplot and raster packages for high-quality visualization and analysis

**TUNAPRINT: The tuna behind the can | 2022-2023**
- Focus Area: Marine Genetics & Science Communication
- Participated in sampling events, DNA extraction, and PCR analysis for tuna traceability research.
- Created educational materials, including a card game, a canned tuna consumer's guide, and a results summary poster, to disseminate project findings to both scientific and public audiences. Check below for the materials!!

**VALORSUL Monitoring Program - CTRSU de S. João da Talha | 2022-Today | Provision of services**
- Focus Area: Environmental Monitoring & Ecosystem Assessment
- Colaborator on the Monitoring Program of Terrestrial and Estuarine ecossistems surrounding a Solid Waste Treatment Plant in Lisbon (CTRSU de S. João da Talha)
- Conducted data collection, processing, and analysis on macroinvertebrates an ichthyofauna
- Produced the Annual Monitoring Report, providing actionable insights ecossytem status

**InterDIS Summer School 2.0**
- Part of the Organizing Committee for the 2nd edition of the da “Summer school for Interdisciplinary Ocean transformation”, with ICES Strategic Initiative on the Integration of Early Career Scientists (SIIECS) for 2024
- Contributed to the review of the evaluation report on the 1st edition of InterDIS (2023) to assess its outcomes and refine future iterations.
- Reviewing of the funding proposal

**Project "Distance between replicates for studying Foraminifera in recent tropical and temperate estuarine environments: methodology and experimental design" | FCUL | December 2019**
- Focus Area: Microfossil Analysis & Experimental Design
- Conducted sample preparation, species identification, sorting, and counting of foraminifera individuals and species to support research

#### Outreach & Science Communication 

**European Researcher's Night 2023 "Science for All - Sustainability and Inclusion" (September 2023)**
From the Ice Age to the plate: the genetic journey of our fishery resources

Such a great experience! On the last friday night of September we were at the National Museum of Natural History and Science sharing the TUNAPRINT project results. We designed a quick and fun game to show what COULD really be inside our tuna cans. Check out our poster and dissemination materials bellow.
