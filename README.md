# Fisheries biologist

# About me

I am an Environmental Biologist with a deep-rooted passion for Fisheries Biology and a specialization in Marine Ecology. 

My passion lies in understanding fish life-history strategies, accurate data collection and the application of statistical modeling to address pressing challenges in fisheries science. I am also particularly driven by the need to bridge scientific findings with real-world applications, ensuring that  our research informs sustainable fisheries management and conservation efforts in accessible and impactful ways. Currently, I am a Research Collaborator at MARE-ULisboa (Marine and Environmental Sciences Centre), where I work with the Fisheries Biology Lab on fish life-history and genetics projects. But beyond the aquatic world, I also venture into terrestrial systems, collaborating with the SRIT and BLIZ teams from the SRC (Stockholm Resilience Centre) on population dynamics models for mammals and plants. 

I thrive in team settings, bringing motivation, creativity, and a meticulous eye for detail to every project. I also have some experience in Environmental Education, which has been reinforced by my commitment to making science accessible and impactful for different audiences.

**My ultimate goal?  Contribute to fisheries research that not only advances our understanding of aquatic ecosystems but also drives solutions for their sustainable management.**

### Outreach & Science Communication 

Engaging with the public and sharing science is one my favorite parts of my work. See below how some of those activities have allowed me to connect with different audiences, communicate complex concepts in an accessible way, and inspire curiosity about fisheries biology and our oceans' sustainability.

> **MSc and PhD Day in Sciences 2023**

At this event, I had the opportunity to meet prospective students, showcasing FCUL’s graduate programs and sharing insights into the MSc in Marine Ecology. It was rewarding to discuss academic pathways and inspire others to dive into marine research.

> **Ciências Open Day 2023**

As part of this event, I led public engagement activities to disseminate research results from my MSc dissertation, "Struggling with Fish Age: A Comparison of Otolith Preparation Techniques to Unravel Age and Growth of Boarfish, Capros aper." Visitors learned how otoliths can reveal fascinating insights into fish age and growth.

> **24th Pavilion of Knowledge “Centro de Ciência Viva” Anniversary**

I participated in public engagement activities for this exciting event, which welcomed over 5,000 participants of all ages. My science communication focused on fish age and growth, using biological materials like otoliths, cleithra, vertebrae, and opercula to explain the tools we use in fisheries research.

> **European Researcher's Night 2023 "Science for All - Sustainability and Inclusion"**

From the Ice Age to the plate: the genetic journey of our fishery resources
It was an incredible experience to participate in this event at the National Museum of Natural History and Science! Representing the TUNAPRINT project, we designed an interactive game to highlight what could really be inside our tuna cans. Visitors explored the science behind DNA analysis and traceability, linking sustainability and fisheries research.
